# Chapter 1 Notes

## Basics

Throughout the book, \\(\mathrm{F}\\) will stand for either a real number,
\\(\mathrm{R}\\), or a complex number, \\(\mathrm{C}\\).

Elements of \\(\mathrm{F}\\) are called *scalars*. The definition scalar is used
to contrast from a vector (defined later).

## Vector Spaces

The Cartesian plane is an example of a vector space, \\(\mathrm{R}^2\\) where

$$
    \mathrm{R}^2
    = \{(x, y) : x, y \in \mathrm{R}\}
$$

and of course \\(\mathrm{R}^3\\) is ordinary space.
