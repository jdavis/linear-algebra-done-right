## Chapter 1 Notes

### Basics

Throughout the book, \\(\F\\) will stand for either a real number,
\\(\R\\), or a complex number, \\(\C\\).

Elements of \\(\F\\) are called *scalars*. The definition scalar is used
to contrast from a vector (defined later).

### Vector Spaces

The Cartesian plane is an example of a vector space, \\(\R^2\\) where:

$$
    \R^2
    = \{(x, y) : x, y \in \R\}
$$

and of course \\(\mathrm{R}^3\\) is ordinary space.

### Lists

A list is a ordered set of numbers. It comes in handy to represent a value from
a vector space like \\(\R^n\\). For example, if \\(x_3 = (5, 8, 13)\\) then \\(x
\in \R^3\\).

0 is often used as a shorthand to represent a list of \\(n\\) zeros:

$$
    0
    = (0, \ldots, 0)
$$

### Vectors

When describing a value from \\(\R^2\\) say \\(x\\) where \\(x = (x_1, x_2)\\)
it can be thought of as an arrow starting at the origin ending at point \\(x\\).
This is a vector.

### Vector Space Formalized

A vector space \\(V\\) is a set with an addition and a scalar multiplication on
\\(V\\) that satisifes these properties:

- Commutativity

$$
    u + v = v + u
    \text{ for all }
    u, v \in V
$$

- Associativity

$$
    (u + v) + w = u (v + w)
    \text{ and }
    (ab)v = a(bv)
    \text{ for all }
    u, v, w \in V
$$

- Additive Identity

$$
    \text{ there exists an element }
    0 \in V
    \text{ such that }
    v + 0 = v
    \text{ for all }
    v \in V
$$

- Additive Inverse

$$
    \text{ for every }
    v \in V,
    \text{ there exists }
    w \in V
    \text{ such that }
    v + w = 0
$$

- Multiplicative Identity

$$
    1v = v
    \text{ for all } v \in V
$$

- Distributive Properties

$$
    a(u +v) = au + av
    \text{ and }
    (a + b)u = au + bu
    \text{ for all }
    a,b \in \F
    \text{ and all }
    u, v \in V
$$

For the rest of the book, \\(V\\) will denote a vector space over \\(\F\\).

###  Polynomials

A function \\(p: \F \to \F\\) is called a polynomial with coefficients in
\\(\F\\) if there exist \\(a_0, \ldots, a_m \in F\\) such that

$$
    p(z) = a_0 + a_1 z + a_x z^2 + \cdots + a_m z^m
$$

for all \\(z \in \F\\).

### Subspaces

A subset \\(U\\) of \\(V\\) is called a subspace of \\(V\\) if \\(U\\) is also a
vector space.

For example

$$
    \{(x_1, x_2, 0) : x_1, x_2 \in \F\}
$$

is a subspace of \\(\F^3\\).

We have the following properties of subspaces:

- Additive Identity: insures the additive identity of \\(V\\) is in \\(U\\).

$$
    0 \in U
$$

- Closed under Addition: insures that addition makes sense on \\(U\\).

$$
    u, v \in U
    \text{ implies }
    u + v \in U
$$

- Closed under Scalar Multiplication: insures that sclar multiplication makes
sense.

$$
    a \in \F
    \text{ and }
    u \in U
    \text{ implies }
    au \in U
$$

### Sums

Given \\(U_1, \ldots, U_m\\) subspaces of \\(V\\), then sum (\\(U_1 + \cdots +
U_m\\)) is the set of all possible sums of elements of \\(U_1, \ldots, U_m\\).
Formally as:

$$
    U_1 + \cdots + U_m
    =
    \{
        u_1
        + \cdots
        + u_m
        : u_1 \in U_1, \ldots, u_m \in U_m
    \}
$$

### Sum Examples

Let

$$
    U = \{(x, 0, 0) \in \F^3 : x \in \F\},
    W = \{(0, y, 0) \in \F^3 : y \in \F\}
$$

Then:

$$
    U + W
    = \{(x, y, 0) : x, y \in \F\}
$$
